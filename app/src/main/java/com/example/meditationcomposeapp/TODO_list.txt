0. Mock web responses and process them

1. Field validation visibility: error states

2.0. Research about navigation; Separate navigation model into different parts.
2. Passing values between screens:
    When navigating from LoginScreen into EnterLoginScreen
    pass entered email value if it's not empty
    &
    Login value to enterCodeScreen

3. Animated transitions between screens

4. Animate code numbers when input code is incorrect
    (horizontal hesitation and perhaps painting them red while anim)

5. Add Info/Warning Dialog to display errors if occurred
